# 2. Binding rules
> There are **4 rules** how the `this` keyword gets **bound** to the
> **execution context** and they depend on the **call site**.

1. [New binding](new-binding.md#2.1. New binding)
2. [Explicit binding](explicit-binding.md#2.2. Explicit-binding)
3. [Implicit binding](implicit-binding.md#2.3. Implicit-binding)
4. [Default binding](default-binding.md#2.4. Default-binding)

Please note that there is precedence in these rules.
